  <h2>
    Peer Instruction: Active Learning ("flipped classroom") in CS
  </h2>
  <p>
    I have adopted Peer Instruction (PI), an active learning pedagogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2012, I worked with Leo Porter, Beth Simon, and others on Peer Instruction (PI), an
    active learning pedagogy initially developed by Eric Mazur at Harvard to
    teach introductory Physics. The PI community has shown that PI is effective
    in CS Education, including higher exam scores, lower WDF rates, and higher retention
    in the major.

    Knoxcraft: Code that builds 3D stuff in Minecraft for Intro CS!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Students write code in Java, Python, or Blockly that builds 3D structures.
    Then they run the code in Minecraft to visualize their structures.

    Cloudcoder: Short programming exercises in your browser
  </h2>
  <p>
    Cloudcoder is a collaboration with <a href="http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/">David Hovemeyer</a> 
    at York College. It is an open source system that lets students solve short
    programming exercises in the web browser,
    with a 'submit' button that gives immediate feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cloudcoder also has an open repository of short programming exercises.
    Math faculty have been assigning problems from question banks
    for decades; why can't we do the same?

  <h2>
    Startup Term: Entrepreneurship in the Liberal Arts
  </h2>
  <p>
    I worked with <a href="http://www.johnfdooley.com/">John Dooley</a> and
    <a href="https://www.knox.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/business-and-management/faculty/spittell-john">John Spittel</a>
    to design Startup Term, a 10-week immersive experience. Teams of students
    submit a business and marketing plan and "pitch" their startup idea. If accepted,
    instead of attending classes for a term, they show up to an office suite in downtown Galesburg
    and (with some advice from us) handle everything a small business
    would need to deal with: partnership agreements, banking, intellectual property,
    terms of service (if they are running a web service), market research,
    financial projections; you name it, they have to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the term, the have to pitch their business to a panel of judges,
    including local business leaders, Knox alumni entrepreneurs, and members of Knox's
    Board of Trustees.
