  <h2>Knoxel: Minecraft-inspired coding for intro CS</h2>
  <p>
    Have you ever wanted to learn 3D arrays by writing code in Python
    or Javascript that creates structures in a voxel based world?
  </p>
  <p>
    You have? Great! Then check out <a href="knoxel">Knoxel</a>, our
    voxel-based coding environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Full disclosure: We also wrote two versions of a server-side
    Minecraft mod, one for the now-defunct Canarymod and one for Spongepowered, 
    that put all of this inside a full Minecraft server. But, sadly, our mods
    were never entirely stable and it was hard to keep the server up and running.

  <h2>
    Peer Instruction: Active Learning ("flipped classroom") in CS
  </h2>
  <p>
    I have adopted Peer Instruction (PI), an active learning pedagogy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2012, I worked with Leo Porter, Beth Simon, and others on Peer Instruction (PI), an
    active learning pedagogy initially developed by Eric Mazur at Harvard to
    teach introductory Physics. The PI community has shown that PI is effective
    in CS Education, including higher exam scores, lower WDF rates, and higher retention
    in the major.

    Startup Term: Interdisciplinary Entrepreneurship in the Liberal Arts
  </h2>
  <p>
    I worked with <a href="http://www.johnfdooley.com/">John Dooley</a>,
    <a href="https://www.knox.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/business-and-management/faculty/spittell-john">John Spittel</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.timstedman.com/">Tim Stedman</a>
    to create Startup Term.
  </p>
  <p>
    Startup Term is an immersive, Interdisciplinary 10-week experience where teams of students
    found a company and work on their business for all of their 
    academic credit. Instead of studying in a classroom, teams meet 5 days a week in an office suite off-campus, 
    and instead of final exams, students give a Sharktank-style final pitch to a panel
    of judges and potential investors.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the term, students handle everything a fledgling business might need to
    handle, such as partnership agreements, banking, intellectual property,
    terms of service, market research, financial projections, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Startup term is a fantastic! It's the most fun thing I've worked on in academia.

    Knoxcraft: Code that builds 3D stuff in Minecraft for Intro CS!
  </h2>
  <p>
    Students write code in Java, Python, or Blockly that builds 3D structures.
    Then they run the code in Minecraft to visualize their structures.

    Cloudcoder: Short programming exercises in your browser
  </h2>
  <p>
    Cloudcoder is a collaboration with <a href="http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/">David Hovemeyer</a>
    at York College. It is an open source system that lets students solve short
    programming exercises in the web browser,
    with a 'submit' button that gives immediate feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cloudcoder also has an open repository of short programming exercises.
    Math faculty have been assigning problems from question banks
    for decades; why can't we do the same?

  <h2>
    Increasing Diversity and Inclusivity in STEM Education
  </h2>
  <p>
    Knox was selected to the AAC&amp;U's TIDES program, which was funded by a $4.3 million gift
    from the Helmsley Foundation. Only 20 schools out of over 200 who submitted grant
    proposals were selected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Full disclosure: We were an "honorable mention", which means we didn't get
    the $250K we asked for, but they paid for our institution to attend the
    TIDES conference every summer, and we incorporated much of what we learned
    into our CS courses. It was a great opportunity.
